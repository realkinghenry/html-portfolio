<h1>The Best Movies Ever, According to Lamar</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time:</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Wolf of Wall Street (Leonardo DiCaprio)</h3>
<p>There is just something about this movie that a makes me want to watch it over and over again.  It just has a classic vibes to it that I love.</p>
<h3>Pursuit of Happiness</h3>
<p>I never understood the full scope of the movie as a kid, but I was always moved by it, especially the ending scene where Will was clapping in triumph.</p>
<h3>Harry Potter (all of them...)</h3>
<p>Pure nostalgia.  I remember going to watch the first film's premiere while in Jamaica with my older sister and nephew.</p>
